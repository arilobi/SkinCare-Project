        <h3>Best skin care routine for dry skin on face</h3>
        <h3>________________________________</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>While the causes may differ, anyone can practice a skin routine for dry skin that will be to their benefit.

            “As skin dries, it shrinks and causes cracks, which can get deep, painful, and even start to bleed. Cracks allow germs and bacteria to enter the body, which can potentially lead to a skin infection,” says Melanie Speed, RN, BSN, CAN, and owner of Flawless Aesthetics.

    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cleanse</b> with a hydrating cleanser that doesn’t disrupt the outer skin layer.</li>
            <li><b>Tone</b> with an alcohol-free toner to restore skin pH.</li>
            <li><b>Target</b> specific skin concerns with a serum</li>
            <li><b>Moisturize</b> with a nourishing, noncomedogenic moisturizer to lock in hydration.</li>
            <li><b>Protect</b> from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays to prevent sun damage.</li>
        </ol>
