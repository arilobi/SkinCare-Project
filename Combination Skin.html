        <p>Figuring out the best skin care routine for combination skin can feel a bit like you’re going in circles. What happens when your skin decides it’s going to be oily and dry?
            <br><br>
        <p> There’s no need to worry. It might not be easy, but it’s definitely possible to find a routine that softens dry patches and combats shininess. It doesn’t matter what percentage of your skin is oily and dry, or if your dry and oily patches aren’t in the most common areas — the approach is the same.</p>

                <li><b>Cleanse</b>  It’s important to remove any buildup that occurs overnight.</li>
                <li><b>Tone</b> removes any oil that your cleanser didn’t and balances your skin’s pH levels. Make sure to grab an alcohol-free toner.</li>
                <li><b>Serum</b> hydrates and protects your skin. It’s best to opt for a serum with hyaluronic acid.</li>
                <li><b>Moisturize.</b> With combination skin, you’ll want two moisturizers. For dry areas, choose a creamy formula. For oily parts, choose a lightweight, water-based formula.</li>
                <li><b>Sunscreen</b> Choose a lightweight formula with at least SPF 30.</li>
                <li><b>Makeup</b> If desired, use lightweight products. Foundation and concealer should have oil-free formulas.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cleanse.</b> Cleanse day and night. A nighttime cleanser should remove any makeup remnants in addition to natural buildup.</li>
                <li><b>Makeup remover.</b> If you wear makeup, makeup remover helps keep pores unclogged and gives your skin a chance to breathe. Micellar water is one of the gentlest products to use for this.</li>
                <li><b>Exfoliant.</b> Once per week, exfoliants are great for removing dead skin cells, which keeps pores clear and relieves dry areas.</li>
                <li><b>Facial mask.</b> Once per week, try multi-masking, which is when you apply different masks to different areas of the face.</li>
                <li><b>Serum, treatment, or moisturizer.</b> Evenings are best for stronger products, so choose an emollient-rich moisturizer for dry areas.</li>
